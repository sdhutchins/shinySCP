## What is shinySCP?

`shinySCP` is a shiny app built for fun to mimic existing SCP apps such as WinSCP or FileZilla. It depends upon the `shiny`, `shinythemes`, and `ssh`packages.

## Why shinySCP?

This is just a way for me to learn more about shiny and see one of my ideas come to life.

## Who are you?

I'm Shaurita Hutchins. You can browse my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/sdhutchins) if you'd like.

## Can I contribute?

Of course, please check out the [repository](https://github.com/sdhutchins/shinySCP) for this app.

## What's next for shinySCP?

Currently, the implementation only allows you to login to your server.

Going forward...I have a few ideas for this app...

1. Allow upload and download of files via the [ssh](https://github.com/ropensci/ssh) package.
2. Allow users to view contents of their files.
3. Allow file operations such as deletion or creation.
4. Allow users to perform other commands via ssh.
