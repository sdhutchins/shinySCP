# shinySCP

shinySCP is a shiny app built for fun to mimic existing SCP apps such as WinSCP or FileZilla.

## Why shinySCP?

This is just a way for me to learn more about shiny and see one of my ideas come to life.

## Requirements

```r
pkgs <- c('ssh', 'shiny', 'shinythemes')
install.packages(pkgs)
```

## What's next for shinySCP?

Currently, the implementation only allows you to login to your server.

Going forward...I have a few ideas for this app...

- [] Allow upload and download of files via the [ssh]() package.
- [] Allow users to view contents of their files.
- [] Allow file operations such as deletion or creation.
- [] Allow users to perform other commands via ssh.
